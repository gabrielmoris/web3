## How blockchain Works

The information is hashed wirh a requirement that has to be satisfyed. Then the hash of each block of information would be used as a part of the data for the next block and that block would be hashed.

If someone tries to change the ata of one block, the whole chain would be invalid because wont fullfill the requirements.
